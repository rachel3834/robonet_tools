Colour analysis procedure
=========================

* Select trio of best-quality gri reference images and use these to reduce
both lightcurve and colour data for LSC

* Determine offset from true WCS for ref_image_wcs.fits in all filters.

* Apply the offset to the star_catalog table coordinates.

* Run calibrate_photometry, matching the reference image data against VPHAS+

* Run combine_colour_data to produce a combined star catalog with calibrated and instrumental magnitudes.

* Run plot_colour_diagrams.
